% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} computer aided system for pathology detection and diagnosis are based on a feature space constructed from abundant clinical attributes.
The noninvasive, inexpensive and well-established technology of electrocardiographic signal in mobile health or personal health has the greatest popularity in heart function analysis. 
Automated arrhythmia analysis provides indispensable assist in long-term clinical monitoring, and a large number of approaches have been proposed for the task, easing the diagnosis of arrhythmic changes as well as further inspection, e.g., heart rate variability or heart turbulence analysis.
Information in  electrocardiography signals related to the cardiac electrical activity is therefore represented by a large dimensional space from the data analysis angle.
Plenty of parameters were extracted from the high dimensional data as the indicators for diagnosis. 
The large dimensional space hinders a proper interpretation of the embedded symbolic physiology in the feature space \cite{delgado2009dimensionality}.
However, the increasingly developing of the artificial intelligence domain and machine learning methods provides powerful tools to deal with the large dimensional electrocardiography data.





Lots of algorithms had been proposed for the classification and detection of electrocardiography signals. 
The electrocardiography classification or detection task had been divided into two parts: the feature extraction process and classifier. 
Simple classifier such as linear discriminants \cite{chaza} and kNN \cite{melgan}, more complex classifiers like neural networks \cite{jiang, olmez, lin, osowski}, fuzzy inference engines \cite{osowski, kundu}, hidden Markov model \cite{andreao, coast}, independent component analysis \cite{zhu} and support vector machine  \cite{melgan, kampoura, khandoker} were also adopted by lots of researchers.  



Beyond the classifier, the performance of a recognition system highly depends on the determination of extracted electrocardiography features. Time domain features, frequency domain features, and statistical measures features for six fundamental waves (PQRSTU) had been used in feature extraction process \cite{chia}. 
Time domain features like morphological features include shapes, amplitudes, and durations were adapted primarily in \cite{jekova, christove, can}, frequency domain features like wavelet transformation were widely used \cite{inan}, \cite{banerjee} stationary features like higher-order statistics also had been developed. 
Principal component analysis \cite{stam} and Hermite functions \cite{lager} have been used in electrocardiography classification and related analysis technologies as well.
Almost every single published paper proposes a new set of features to be used, or a new combination of the existing ones \cite{mar}.


The results from these algorithms or models were not amenable to expert labelling, as well as for the identification of complex relationships between subjects and clinical conditions \cite{clifford}.
But for the ambulatory electrocardiography clinical application, as well as the normal application in daily healthcare monitoring for cardiac function or early warning of heart disease, an automated algorithm or model would have significant meaning.
The application of artificial intelligence methods has become an important trend in electrocardiography for the recognition and classification of different arrhythmia types \cite{clifford}. 
The data explosion puts forward the new request to the method of data processing and information mining.



Over the past decades computational techniques proliferated in the pattern recognition field, simultaneously the applications in electrocardiography recognition, detection and classification for relevant trends, patterns, and outliers. 
Most of the literatures in the electrocardiography classification task were focused on the supervised learning methods, as in unsupervised learning methods were infrequently used, which needs a lot of effort in labelling data. The MIT-BIH database \cite{physionet} was the most widely used data in the classification and detection algorithm developments, while mass unlabelled electrocardiography data had been ignored due to the supervise learning approaches essential. 
Unsupervised learning methods become crucial in mining or analysing unlabelled data, as the unlabelled electrocardiography data accumulated. Unsupervised learning-based approaches and the application to electrocardiogram classification in literatures mainly include clustering-based techniques \cite{lager, nishizawa, maier}, self-adaptive neural network-based methods \cite{palreddy, risk} and some hybrid unsupervised learning systems \cite{tadejko}. 

Manifold learning is a kind of method attempting to uncover the manifold structure in a data set, it can also be considered as a kind of nonlinear dimensional reduction technique.
It has been widely used in multivariate data classification, data analysis, and data visualization.
Manifold learning directly map the input data space into some feature space to find a better descriptor to analysis the real world problems.

\section{Methodology}
The arrhythmia analysis problem can be generally considered as one time series based classification problem from the viewpoint of data analysis.
Consider a set of $n$ electrocardiography based time series data set $\boldsymbol{X} = \{\boldsymbol{x}_i\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, is given as the samples.
Heartbeats in $\boldsymbol{X}$ include both labelled and unlabelled samples, the task is to estimate the labels of unlabelled data with some methods based on the labelled and relative methods.
Here we adopt several manifold learning based techniques to embed the high dimensional input data into some lower dimension subspace. 
With the techniques some data properties were preserved in the embedded subspace (feature space).
Then we train a classifier in the feature space using the labelled data, and use the classifier to classify the unlabelled data. From which we can get the arrhythmia information. 
Here we introduce several manifold learning techniques, the detailed theory and explanation can be accessed from the related literatures.

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{PCA}
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction method, which try to find a linear subspace of lower dimension keeping the largest variance compare to the original feature space.
PCA is by far the most popular unsupervised linear technique.
The most important task in PCA method is to find the principal components of a data set, which can be implemented by finding a linear basis with reduced dimensionality for the input data sets, with the amount of variance in the data is maximal.

Mathematically, consider data set $\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, the embedded subspace with PCA can be denote as $\{\boldsymbol{y}_i\} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ ($d$ and $k$ are the dimension numbers). 
Then the problem of finding the ``best"  $k$ principal components can be transfer to finding $k$-dimensional subspaces that minimize the orthogonal distances.
Solve 
\begin{equation}
\label{equPCA}
\argmin \sum_{ij} (d_{ij}^2 - \Vert \bm{y}_i - \bm{y}_j \Vert^2)
%\argmin_\mathcal{S} \sum_{i=1}^d \Vert \boldsymbol{x}_i - P_\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) \Vert_2^2
\end{equation}
where $P_s(\cdot)$ is the projection onto subspace $\mathcal{S}$.
Solution of this problem is to find a linear mapping $\boldsymbol{M}$ from the original space to subspace $\mathcal{S}$, which maximizes the cost function $trace(\boldsymbol{M}^Tcov(\boldsymbol{X})\boldsymbol{M}))$. Then the data low-dimensional data features $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ of data points $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in original space can be computed by mapping $\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{M}$.
A detailed theory analysis and tutorial can be found in \cite{abdi2010principal} and \cite{shlens2014tutorial} respectively.

%                 Kernel PCA
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Kernel PCA}
The linear mapping could not be an accurate description of data in the nonlinear case, which happens in real world applications like the arrhythmia analysis.
In these cases, PCA will produce a large error measure. 
The geometrically nonlinear surface of data motivated different kinds of modeling approaches include kernel PCA.
Kernel PCA is a reformulation of linear PCA in a high-dimensional space constructed using kernel functions.
Kernel PCA computes the principal eigenvectors of the kernel matrix rather than the covariance matrix in the origin PCA method.
Apparently, constructing the kernel space transfer the linear based PCA into a nonlinear mapping.
The idea behind kernel PCA is to project the data into a new, higher-dimensional feature space.

Mathematically, let $n$ data points (here are the segmented heartbeat sample) $\bm{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be given, suppose $\bm{\phi}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^D$, where $D > d$.
Assume that the mapping in the feature vectors have zero mean which is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \bm{\phi}(\bm{x})_i = 0$. Use $\bm{\Phi} = [\bm{\phi} (\bm{x}_1), \bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_2), \ldots, \bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_n)]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times D}$, apply PCA to $\bm{\Phi}$.
Usually the $\bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_i)$ are unknown and it is not possible to work out the decomposition explicitly, then we define 
\begin{equation}
\kappa(\bm{x}_i, \bm{x}_i) =\bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_i)^T\bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_i)
\end{equation}
and consider $\bm{\Phi}\bm{\Phi}^T = \{\bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_i)^T \bm{\phi}(\bm{x}_i)\}$, so we have kernel matrix under the mapping of $\bm{\phi}(\cdot)$ is $\bm{K} = \{\kappa(\bm{x}_i, \bm{x}_j)\}$.
The principal $d$ eigenvectors of the centered kernel matrix can be computed, then the covariance matrix in feature space is constructed by $\kappa$.
A similar optimization problem can be summarized like in Equation \ref{equPCA} while the projection involves a kernel transformation.
Details of kernel PCA theory and application tutorial can be found in \cite{shawe2004kernel, chatfield2018introduction, van2009dimensionality}.
Kernel PCA is a kernel-based method, the mapping performed greatly relies on the choice of kernel function $\kappa$.
The linear mapping PCA could be equal to a Kernel PCA when a linear kernel is chosen. Typical kernel functions include Gaussian kernel, polynomial kernel etc.

\subsection{Maximum Variance Unfolding (Semidefinite Embedding)}
Since in the kernel PCA based method, the choice of kernel function is quite arbitrary. 
Sometime a poor kernel function could not lead to a good manifold embedding.
Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) is a technique that attempts to solve such problem by learning from data so that the kernel matrix can be obtained, which was formerly known as Semidefinite Embedding \cite{weinberger2006unsupervised}.

The notion of local isometry was proposed in MVU.
In mathematics, an isometry of a manifold is any (smooth) mapping of that manifold into itself, or into another manifold that preserves the notion of distance between points. 
Given $n$ input points $\bm{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and a prescription for identifying neighborhood relations,  find some mapped output  $\bm{y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that both the inputs and outputs are both locally isometric (or approximation locally isometric).
MVU starts with the construction of graph $\mathcal{G}$ illustrates the neighborhood relations. $\bm{x}_i$ is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors, MVU tries to maximize the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between data points, with the constraint that the distances inside $\mathcal{G}$ are preserved.
Mathematically, let $\bm{y}_i$ denote the mapped representation of $\bm{x}_i$, and define a kernel matrix $\bm{K}$ as the outer product of data presentations $\bm{Y}$. After reformulating the problem turns to:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \argmax \sum_{ij}\Vert \bm{y}_i - \bm{y}_j \Vert^2  \\
& s.t. \quad  \Vert \bm{y}_i - \bm{y}_j \Vert^2 = \Vert \bm{x}_i - \bm{x}_j \Vert^2 \quad for \quad \forall (i, j) \in \mathcal{G} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
After we solve the semidefinite programming problem (SDP), the low-dimensional data representation $\bm{Y}$ is obtained by performing an eigenvector decomposition of $\bm{K}$.

\subsection{Isomap}
PCA finds a low-dimensional representation of the data points that best preserves the variance as which measured in the high-dimensional input space.
Later the classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) method was proposed which finds an embedding preserving the inter-point distances\cite{Kruskal1978Multidimensional}. 
The MDS method equivalent to PCA when those distances are Euclidean.
While in many case, the high-dimensional data lies on or near a curved manifold, PCA and MDS may lead a mistake in the some datasets contain essential nonlinear structures that are invisible to them, like in some face recognition dataset.
Isomap builds on classical MDS but seeks to preserve the intrinsic geometry of the data, as captured in the geodesic manifold distances between all pairs of data points \cite{tenenbaum2000isomap}. 

Mathematically, the geodesic distance between the data points  $\{\bm{x}_i\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are computed so as to construct a neighborhood graph $\mathcal{G}$, where every data point $\{\bm{x}_i\}$ is connected with its $k$ nearest neighbors in the dataset.
The shortest path between two points in the graph forms an estimate of geodesic distance, which can be computed using Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm, therefore we can get a pairwise geodesic distance matrix $\mathcal{D}$.
The low-dimensional representation can be achieved by MDS on $\mathcal{D}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Local Linear Embedding}
Local Linear Embedding is a technique that is similar to Isomap and MVU, all try to construct a graph representation of the data points.
Compare to Isomap, LLE only attempts to preserve local properties of data \cite{saul2000introduction}, which are constructed by writing the high-dimensional data points as a linear combination of their nearest neighbors.
In the low-dimensional manifold, LLE attempts to retain the reconstruction weights in the linear combinations as good as possible.



LLE describes the local properties of the manifold around a data point  $\bm{x}_i $ using a linear combination of its $k$ nearest neighbors with related  reconstruction weights $\bm{w}_i$. 
There is an assumption that the manifold is locally linear, which means that $\bm{w}_i$ of datapoints $\bm{x}_i$ are invariant to translation, rotation, and rescaling.
Then the reconstruction weights $\bm{w}_i$ can also reconstruct datapoint $\bm{y}_i$ from its neighbors in the low-dimensional data representation.
Then finding the data representation $\bm{Y}$ can be consider as an optimization problem

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \argmin \sum_{i}\Vert \bm{y}_i - \sum_{j=1}^k w_{ij}\bm{y}_{i_j} \Vert^2  \\
& s.t. \quad  \Vert \bm{y}^{(k)} \Vert= 1  \quad for \quad \forall k\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{y}^{(k)}$ represents the $k$-th column of the solution matrix $\bm{Y}$.

%
%                     LE
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Laplacian Eigenmaps}
Similar to LLE, the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) methods find low-dimensional data representations by preserving manifold's local properties based on pairwise distances of near neighbors.
LE compute distances between data points with its neighbors using weights based on the rule: the first nearest neighbor contributes more to the cost function than the distance between the datapoint and its second nearest neighbor.
The minimization of the cost function in LE is defined as an eigen-problem in spectral graph theory.
 
Consider a neighborbood graph $\mathcal{G}$ in which each data sample $\bm{x}_i$ is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors.
The weights of the edges are computed using Gaussian kernel function:
\begin{equation}
w_{ij} = e^{-\frac{\Vert \bm{x}_i - \bm{x}_j \Vert^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ indicates the Gaussian variance.
Then we can get a sparse adjacency matrix $\bm{W}$, and the optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
\argmin \sum_{ij} \Vert\bm{y}_i - \bm{y}_j \Vert^2 w_{ij}
\end{equation}
Large weights $w_{ij}$ correspond to small distances of $\bm{x}_i$ and $\bm{x}_j$, then the difference between their manifold representation $\bm{y}_i$ and $\bm{x}_j$ highly contributes to the cost function.
So the nearby points in the original space (high-dimensional) are put as close as possible in the low-dimensional manifold, which forms a better representation for input datasets \cite{belkin2003laplacian}.

\subsection{Multilayer Autoencoder}

\lipsum[1-4]

%Different from the former methods


%Multilayer autoencoders are feed-forward neural networks with a certain number of hidden layers.

%Since the SAE based deep structure was capable of extracting representations for the raw inputs, it is simpler and more convenient to extract the features for ECG classification instead of discovery or create features by researchers. Thought it should be mentioned that for clinical reasons some features from the researchers might be great of importance, the features were limited in the morphology aspect, which lacks the ability to use some importance features in the transform-domain features or statistical representations. Another motivation for the deep features was, in the real use of the long-term ECG monitoring, the variances of the data collection devices and the difference in different objects. For example, different Holter manufactories use different collecting chips, or different analog-to-digital sampling rate, or even different digital signal filter parameters. Another factor is the physiological differences of the objects. According to these factors, using the single morphology or time domain features were insufficient, the probability distribution of a certain class is non-exclusive and has variations over multiple directions in the feature space, which makes it impossible to analyze the waveform point by point in the real complicated situation. More robust and invariant features should be extracted and used in the auto-analysis scenes. It is believed that deep architectures can potentially lead to progressively more abstract features at higher layers of the feature, and more abstract features are invariant to most local changes of the input\cite{bengio2013representation}.

%To tackle with these problems, with the stacked autoencoder model the deep invariant features of raw ECG samples can be learned layer by layer. Same as the traditional learning systems, after the feature extracting process, a classifier would be constructed behind the neural network to finish the classification task.

\subsection{The Arrhythmia Classification Problem with Softmax Classifier}
After the manifold embedding procedure for the input $\mathcal{X} = \{\bm{x}_i\}$, we get the data features  $\mathcal{Y} = \{\bm{y}_i\}$ on manifold, with a cascade classifier the arrhythmia classification could be accomplished.

The softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function which had been widely used as a muli-class classifier or the last layer of neural networks \cite{christopher2006pattern}.
In probability theory, the outputs can represent categorical distribution over $k$ possible outcomes.
We use softmax regression as the classifier using the manifold representations as the training samples for the classifier, and then deal the test dataset using the same embedding methods.
The whole task can be illustrated as two phases, the learning phase and the predict(classifying) phase.
In the learning phase, first the ECG samples are embedded into some manifold to get correspond features with dimensional reduction methods as we illustrated in Section II.A to Section II.G.
After the embedding, the achieved  features are used for training a softmax based classifier in a supervised learning method. 
In the prediction phase use the same strategy to get embedded features, and the class label for arrhythmia analysis can be achieved by the trained softmax classifier.
 
Mathematically, let $\{\bm{c}_i\}$ illustrated the class label, $\mathcal{X} = \{\bm{x}_i\}$ as input data, and  $\mathcal{Y} = \{\bm{y}_i\}$ the manifold feature.
Let $1\{\cdot\}$be the indicator function, so that $\bm{1}\{true \quad statement\} = 1$, and $\bm{1}\{false \quad statement\} = 0$. 
Then the cost function for the softmax regression classifier between the ground truth label $c^{(i)}$ and the estimated label $g(\bm{y}^{(i)}, \bm{\theta})$ is computed by loss function L:
\begin{equation}
J(\bm{\theta}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nL(c^{(i)}, g(\bm{y}^{(i)}, \bm{\theta})) + \lambda r(\bm{\theta})
\end{equation}
where the loss function of $\bm{y}^{(i)}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
L(c^{(i)}, g(\bm{y}^{(i)}, \bm{\theta})) = -\sum_{k=1}^K\bm{1}\{c^{(i)} = k\} \log \frac{e^{\bm{\theta}_k^T\bm{y}^{(i)}}}{\sum_{c=1}^Ke^{\bm{\theta}_k^T\bm{y}^{(i)}} }
\end{equation}
while the regularization term we use is
\begin{equation}
r(\bm{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=1}^d \bm{\theta}_{kj}^2
\end{equation}
It is well-known that softmax regression is a convex model which can find a global optimal solution \cite{ren2017robust}.



\section{Experiments And Results}
We include the above mentioned methods for the ECG arrhythmia classification task for a comparative study for an illustration of manifold learning in time series based biomedical signal analysis.
In this section we first make a short description about the task and data types since this problem had been quite well discussed in related literatures, after which the experiment flows are illustrated.


%While the autoencoder based method 
\subsection{ECG Arrhythmia \& Heartbeat Classification}

After the segmentation for the ECG records, we got plenty of ECG waveform samples with variety categories. 
Since different physiological disorder may be reflected on the different type of abnormal heartbeat rhythms. 
For the task of classification, it is quite important to determine the classes would be used. 
In the early literatures, there were no unified class labels for an ECG classification problem. 
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database was the first available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors; it played an important role in stimulating manufacturers of arrhythmia analyzers to compete by objectively measurable performance. 
The annotations in the open database for the ECG categories adopted the ANSI/AAMI EC57: 1998/(R)2008 standard AAMI (2008), which recommended to group the heartbeats into five classes: on-ectopic beats (N); supraventricular ectopic beat (S); ventricular ectopic beat (V); fusion of a V and a N (F); unknown beat type (Q). These classes or labels have been widely used in the ECG classification tasks. 
The normal beat, supraventricular ectopic beat and the ventricular ectopic beat categories were used much more frequently while the unknown beat type were abandoned because of its clinical valueless.

The most popular dataset used in arrhythmia analysis task is the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database [23] which contains 48 half-hour recordings each containing two 30-min ECG lead signals (lead I and lead II), sampled at 340Hz. 
However, only the lead I was used in this study. 
In agreement with the AAMI recommended practice, the four recordings with paced beats were removed from the analysis. 

Besides, a unlabelled data set of ambulatory electrocardiography were used in this study, which includes recordings of 100 subjects with partial arrhythmia ECG samples. 
This dataset would be used in the autoencoder pre-training, which has been quite popular in the deep learning literatures.
Even though we explore autoencoder method from a manifold angle, a pre-training procedure is powerful strategy in extracting manifold representations for arrhythmia analysis.




\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
In the preprocessing stage, filtering algorithms were adapted to remove the artifact signals from the ECG signal. 
The signals include baseline wander, power line interference, and high-frequency noise. 
The segmentation and R wave detection algorithms had been explored in \cite{afonso} and segmentation program of Laguna \cite{sornmo2006electrocardiogram} was adapted, which also had been validated by other related work \cite{chaza}. 
After segmentation, the data samples become $340$-dimensional time series.

\subsection{Intrinsic Dimension Analysis}
The dimension of the embedding is a key parameter for manifold feature achieving.  
If the dimension is too small, important data features are "collapsed", meanwhile if the dimension is too large, the projection into a manifold is too large, leading to a noisy or unstable data feature.
When performing the manifold learning methods, the learning parameter settings could be quite arbitrary sometimes.
The intrinsic dimension analysis could help for the parameter determination.
Especially in the neural network based autoencoder, there is an insufficiency of method for determining the dimension for output layer.
Intrinsic dimension analysis provide a reasonable method for parameter determination.

The widely adopted method of intrinsic dimension analysis include correlation dimension estimation, nearest neighbor dimension estimation\cite{costa2005estimating}, geodesic minimum spanning tree\cite{costa2004geodesic}, packing numbers \cite{kegl2003intrinsic}, maximum likelihood estimation method \cite{levina2005maximum}, etc.
Here we use the the maximum likelihood estimation method for intrinsic dimension analysis.
The dimension from the input dimension turns to $14$ with the maximum likelihood estimation based intrinsic dimension analysis.


\subsection{Sample Imbalanced Treatment}
For the arrhythmia analysis, a typical problem from the viewpoint of data analysis is the unbalancedness of data.
It is due to the characters from the cardiac physiological activity.
Even for some severe heart disease, the ECG achieved would include much more normal beats than the arrhythmia beats after segmentation.
The unbalancedness property could always bring a high accuracy in a multi-class classification problem.
Usually, a confusion matrix had been build for the performance assess to prove the validity of proposed methods.
However, here we try to
